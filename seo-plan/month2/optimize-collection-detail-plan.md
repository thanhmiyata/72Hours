- ✅ Include brand name "72 HRS" at end

**Good title tag structure:**
```
Primary Keyword | Secondary Keyword | Brand Name
Earthquake Kit | 72 Hour Emergency Kit | 72 HRS
```

**TITLE TAG OPTIONS (A/B Testing Opportunities):**

**Option 1: Direct (Current Recommendation)**
```
Earthquake Kit | 72 Hour Emergency Kit | 72 HRS
[58 characters - PERFECT]
```

**Option 2: Benefit-Focused**
```
Earthquake Kit - FEMA-Compliant 72 Hour Supply | 72 HRS
[58 characters]
```

**Option 3: Commercial Intent**
```
Best Earthquake Kit | 72 Hour Emergency Preparedness | 72 HRS
[64 characters - might truncate]
```

**Option 4: Value Proposition**
```
Earthquake Kit | Ready-to-Use Emergency Supplies | 72 HRS
[57 characters]
```

**RECOMMENDATION**: Option 1 or Option 4 (test both)

**Shopify Implementation:**

- **Best Practice**: Hard-code title in collection settings for precise control

**Notes:**
- Don't stuff keywords
- Title must be attractive, click-worthy
- Ensure unique for this page (not duplicate with other collections)

## 📍 **WHERE & HOW TO IMPLEMENT - STEP BY STEP GUIDE**

### **📍 WHERE: Implementation Location on Shopify**

#### **Option 1: Use Theme Editor (RECOMMENDED for beginners)**
**Path**: Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Customize → Templates → Collection template

#### **Option 2: Edit Theme Code Directly (ADVANCED)**
**Path**: Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Actions → Edit code
**Files to edit**:
- `templates/collection.liquid` (or collection template you're using)
- `sections/collection-template.liquid` (if theme has section structure)

---

### **🛠️ HOW: Detailed Implementation Guide**

#### **STEP 1: Backup & Preparation**

**1.1. Backup current theme:**
```
Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Actions → Download
```
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Always backup before editing code!

**1.2. Identify theme structure:**
- Go to **Edit code** → Find collection template file
- Common file names:
  - `templates/collection.liquid`
  - `templates/collection.json`
  - `sections/collection-template.liquid`

**1.3. Find `<head>` section:**
- Schema JSON-LD must be placed in `<head>` tag
- Or before closing `</head>` tag

---

#### **STEP 2: Implement CollectionPage Schema**

**2.1. Code location:**
- File: `templates/collection.liquid` or `sections/collection-template.liquid`
- Place in `<head>` section or in collection template

**2.2. Code to add (JSON-LD format):**

```liquid
{% if collection.handle == 'earthquake-kits' %}
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CollectionPage",
  "name": "{{ collection.title }}",
  "description": "{{ collection.description | strip_html | truncate: 160 }}",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "An earthquake kit should contain essential supplies to sustain you and your family for at least 72 hours following a major earthquake. A comprehensive earthquake kit includes food, water, medical supplies, tools, and communication devices. Our earthquake kits are designed to FEMA guidelines and include carefully curated items to provide maximum safety and comfort during an emergency situation."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How many people does this earthquake kit serve?",

    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Where should I store my earthquake kit?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your earthquake kit should be stored in an easily accessible location that won't be blocked during an earthquake.

      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I customize my earthquake kit?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While our pre-assembled earthquake kits are designed to be comprehensive and ready-to-use, you can add additional items to your earthquake kit to meet specific requirements. Contact our team if you need assistance customizing your earthquake kit."

      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
{% endif %}
```

          }
        }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  ]
}
</script>
{% endif %}

    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "{{ shop.url }}"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,

---

### **⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING**

#### **Issue 1: Schema not displaying**
**Causes:**
- Code placed in wrong location (not in `<head>`)
- Liquid syntax error
- Collection handle doesn't match

**Solution:**
- Check code in `<head>` section
- Verify `collection.handle == 'earthquake-kits'` is correct
- Check Liquid syntax errors in theme code editor

#### **Issue 2: Validation errors**
**Common errors:**
- Missing required properties
- Invalid JSON format
- Invalid URLs

**Solution:**
- Use [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to check JSON format
- Ensure all URLs are absolute (start with `https://`)
- Check required fields according to Schema.org docs

#### **Issue 3: FAQ not displaying rich results**
**Causes:**
- Google needs 2-4 weeks to index
- Not enough FAQs (need 5-7 minimum)
- Content quality insufficient

**Solution:**
- Wait 2-4 weeks after implementation
- Ensure 7-10 FAQs
- Request indexing in GSC

#### **Issue 4: Theme conflict**
**Causes:**
- Theme update overwrites custom code
- App conflicts

**Solution:**
- Use theme customization files instead of direct edit (if theme supports)
- Document changes to re-apply after theme updates
- Test after theme/app updates

---

- **Format**: JSON-LD (recommended) or Microdata
- **Best Practice**: Include all 7-10 FAQs for maximum featured snippet opportunities

**Code Example (JSON-LD in head):**
```liquid
{% if collection.handle == 'earthquake-kits' %}
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {% for block in section.blocks %}
      {% if block.type == 'faq' %}
